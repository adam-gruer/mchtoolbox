=================================================================================================

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.com/ropenscilabs/mchtoolbox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ropenscilabs/mchtoolbox)

Use `mchtoolbox` to calculate percentiles and z-scores for a childâ€™s sex and age for BMI, weight, height, and head circumference based on CDC growth charts.

### Expected Input

`cdc_growth()` takes as input a data.frame with the following columns (**units**):

-   sex: 1=male, 2=female
-   agemos: months
-   height: cm
-   weight: kg
-   headcir: cm (optional)

Installation
------------

Install `mchtoolbox` from Github:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/mchtoolbox")
```

Example
-------

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
## NHANES example data is included with package
create_cdc_growth(nhanes_data)
```

### Project origin

This project was begun during the [2018 rOpenSci unconference](unconf18.ropensci.org): <https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues/49>

### Original summary from @monicagerber

> Percentiles and z scores for BMI using the CDC reference charts ([SAS program](https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/growthcharts/resources/sas.htm)). I've found 1 package ([`childsds`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/childsds/index.html)) that does this, but does not have all of the options as the SAS macro. Importantly, it doesn't calculate %BMIp95 (percent of the 95th percentile of BMI), which is being used more in obesity research. The [`zscorer`](https://nutriverse.validmeasures.org/zscorer/index.html) package only uses WHO growth charts. The CDC charts are standard in US pediatric obesity research. I have been in contact with the author of the SAS macro and he is very nice and fully supportive of turning this into an R package!
